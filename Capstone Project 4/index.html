    <p>Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and
    proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include
    number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of
    shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a
    foundation for all mathematics).</p>
