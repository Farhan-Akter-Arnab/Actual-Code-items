    <h1>Pi (π)</h1>
    <p>The number π is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to
    its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. The number π appears in many formulae across mathematics and physics. It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers, although fractions such
    as 22/7 are commonly used to approximate it.</p>

    <p>π is commonly defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference C to its diameter d. The ratio C/d is constant, regardless of the circle's size. For example, if a circle has twice the
    diameter of another circle, it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio C/d. This definition of π implicitly makes use of flat (Euclidean) geometry; although the notion
    of a circle can be extended to any curve (non-Euclidean) geometry, these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula
    π = C/d.</p>
