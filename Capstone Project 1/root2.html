    <p><b>The square root of 2</b> (approximately 1.4142) is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself or squared, equals the number 2. It may be written in mathematics as √2 or 2<sup>1/2</sup>.</p>

    <p>It is an algebraic number, and therefore not a transcendental number. Technically, it should be
    called the principal square root of 2, to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property. The square root of 2 can be also known as <b>Pythagoras'</b> constant.</p>
    <p>The square of 2 can be availed through the Pythagorean theorem, where it is said that the sum of squares of two sides adjacent to the right angle is equal to the square of the largest side, known as <abbr title="Side opposite to the right angle">The Hypotenuse</abbr>.</p>
