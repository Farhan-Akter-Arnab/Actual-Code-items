    <h1>The Golden Ratio</h1>
    <p>In mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the
    larger of the two quantities. Expressed algebraically, for quantities a and b with a > b > 0, a is in a golden ratio to b, if:</p>
    <p> (a+b)/a = a/b = φ </p>

    This constant value φ satisfies the equation φ<sup>2</sup> = φ + 1, and its value is about 1.618033988749.... This number is an irrational number [don't be confused with the word ratio in it]. This number has been prioritized not only in Mathematics but also in Science and art. The golden ratio was called the extreme and mean ratio by Euclid, and the divine proportion by Luca Pacioli; and
    also goes by other names.
