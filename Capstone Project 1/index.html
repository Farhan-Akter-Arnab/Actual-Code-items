    <h1>Mathematical Constants</h1>
    <p>This page would help to understand about the four fundamental mathematical constants, which are useful in various aspects in mathematics, physics, science, technology, architecture, art, or even history. Mathematical Constants could be rational or irrational. Rational numbers could be availed as fractions, but irrational numbers could not. Nevertheless, these irrational numbers are very much essential for many things. So this website would help in the understanding of the four irrational mathematical constants. The constants which would be discussed here are:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="root2.html">√2</a></li>
            <li><a href="pi.html">π</a></li>
            <li><a href="phi.html">φ</a></li>
            <li><a href="euler.html">e</a></li>
        </ul>
