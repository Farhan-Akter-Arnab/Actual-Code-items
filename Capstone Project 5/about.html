    <p>All of the Mathematicians have played a pivotal role in the realm of Mathematics, Science, and the civilisation we live today. Their inventions have carved out the way for us to get access to the technologies we use now. The website is made possible because of these Mathematicians. Although it was not possible to include the names of all the Mathematicians, all of them deserve dignity and respect from this Mathematical World. However, some of the Mathematicians have played more important roles than that of others, and based on their ground-breaking discoveries, the base of the world we live has been built. We must do something for the people of the World through Mathematics just like this. For this we need to strive for the real essence of Mathematics. Mathematics is not a matter of cruelty or difficulty, it is a matter of amazement, fun, problem-solving, brainstorming and much more! We will make a vow from now on to work in the realm of Mathematics. We hope that this Mathematical World would help you in that.</p>
