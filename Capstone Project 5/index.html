    <p>Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and
    proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include
    number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of
    shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a
    foundation for all mathematics).</p>

    <p>Mathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from
    nature or—in modern mathematics—purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms.
    Mathematics uses pure reason to prove properties of objects, a proof consisting of a succession of applications of
    deductive rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of
    abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under
    consideration.</p>

    <p>Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social
    sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are
    independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are
    developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are
    developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical
    applications.</p>
